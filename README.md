# CCircle: Learn to code with Python!

## [Setup](index.md)

### Highlights:
* No prior programming experience required.
* Learn the fundamentals of computer science through games.
* Everything is written in Python, so you can go down the 'how does this work?' rabbit hole as far as you want.

### Checklist (Prioritized!):
- [ ] Windows, OSX, Linux support.
    - [ ] Full OSX support for existing cc functionality.
        - [x] replace windows-native windowing with GLFW (OS-agnostic windowing)
        - [ ] opengl++ (Mac requires OpenGL 3.2+) -> rewrite primitives rendering
            - [ ] Get Scenario1 working.
                - [ ] Certain things from [Image api](https://mathcircle.github.io/ccircle/apidoc_image).
            - [ ] Textured circles.
            - [ ] Parent Shape class
            - [ ] The shape API is atrocious lol

    - [ ] Pretend to be new, make youtube video of setup.
    - [ ] Walk through it with someone, take notes for improvement.
- [ ] New things!
    - [ ] Intermediate graphics tutorial showing Double Buffered VBO performance.
