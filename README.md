    * Multi-player Game Development: Client/Server (http & tcp)
    * TODO
        * Audio Synthesis
        * Data Structures
        * Databases
        * AI
        * Machine Learning
        * Security / Cryptography 
        * Various 3D Graphics topics:
            * Quaternions and matrix math
            * Ray-tracing
            * Bounding Boxes and Object collision
