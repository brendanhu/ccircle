# CCircle: Learn to code with Python!

## [Setup](index)

### Highlights:
* No prior programming experience required.
* Learn the fundamentals of computer science through games.
* Everything is written in Python, so you can go down the 'how does this work?' rabbit hole as far as you want.

### Checklist (Prioritized!):
- [ ] Windows, OSX, Linux support.
    - [ ] Full OSX support.
